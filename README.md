# budgetr
A short budgeting app on a rainy day

As of now Budgetr is capable of two functions, adding a catagory or modifiying an existing catagory.

Selecting to add a catagory will allow you to create a new catagory in the DB with your choice of name

Selecting to modify an existing catagory will allow you to select a catagory by ID number and add or subtract from the value of that catagory.

THINGS TO BE WORKED ON:

1. User flow; restarting the program once it reaches an endpoint and displaying the updated database to the user in a way that is easy to see

2. Increased functionality; still deciding...

3. MongoDB instead of MySQL; both are equally servicable in this scenerio, I just like Mongo more
